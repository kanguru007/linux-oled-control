Installation
============


1. Install AutoKey
==================

https://github.com/autokey/autokey
(also available in the Pop!_Shop)


2. Install libvibrant
=====================

https://github.com/libvibrant/libvibrant


3. Run the install script
=========================

sh install.sh


p.s. You may have to change the FN Key codes in AutoKey if your computer uses different keycodes than Thinkpad's

p.s.2 Brightness control is done in software, not using PWM. Limited color palette at lower brighnesses but always a temporally quiet picture.
